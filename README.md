# 📕TECHTIONARY.COM - Jaden Leonard
### Created w/ ReactJS⚛️ + Firebase🔥

### 🗒️Description:
#### - As an 18 year old developer, I come across weird techy words every day. When I try to look them up, it seems like no one online even knows what they mean either... that or they use more weirder tech-ier words that never get to the point. It really gives me a headache. So I decied to create a central, reliable, massive dictionary that expert-developers, hello-worlders, and non-programmers can all use to get short 1-3 sentence easy to understand definitions for complicated words in the computer science industry.
